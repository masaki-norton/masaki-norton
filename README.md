### Hi, I'm Masaki! ✌️

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist, interested in all things AI.\
Actually, I'm interested in basically anything. I love to learn, above all else!

Looking to ride the Robotics x AI wave. This, in my opinion, is the next big step.

## About Me
Born in Japan, raised in the US. Thanks to my parents, I can communicate fluently in both English and Japanese.\
Tokyo is my home now🗼

Before Tokyo, I lived in Niseko Hokkaido, selling software to hotels. I also looked after the company financials.\
And yes, I love snowsports.

### 🧑‍💻Currently Working on...
- My own projects, related to computer vision and practical applications, with a sustainability twist.
- Looking through Kaggle Grand Masters' notebooks and literally copying them, line by line. This is great practice in my opinion. It's the same way you learn piano or copywriting. Learn from the masters first, then create your own.

### 🤔 Some recent thoughts / Questions I ask myself these days (updated periodically)
- Where is humanity currently, in our "tech-tree"? Where are we heavily developed? Where are we lacking? Compared to "average"? We only have a sample size of one, but I think about this one a lot.
- [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) theory is really, really scary.
- Will we still use toilet paper in the year 2100.
- "People are rational thinkers" is the most ludicrous (yet obvious) assumption in economics.
- Recently bought a [SkyWatcher Classic 150P Dobsonian](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/sky-watcher-classic-150p) telescope. Bought it used, best $200 I spent in a while. Something about looking up at the sky gives you a sense of being human. Highly recommend. Plus, your neighbors will appreciate it.
