### Hi, I'm Masaki! ‚úåÔ∏è

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist, interested in all things AI.\
Actually, I'm interested in basically anything. I love to learn, above all else!

Looking to ride the Robotics x AI wave. This, in my opinion, is the next big step.

## About Me
Born in Japan, raised in the US. Thanks to my parents, I can communicate fluently in both English and Japanese.\
Tokyo is my home nowüóº

Before Tokyo, I lived in Niseko Hokkaido, selling software to hotels. I also looked after the company financials.\
And yes, I love snowsports.

### üßë‚ÄçüíªCurrently Working on...
- My own projects, related to computer vision and practical applications, with a sustainability twist.
- Looking through Kaggle Grand Masters' notebooks and literally copying them, line by line. This is great practice in my opinion. It's the same way you learn piano or copywriting. Learn from the masters first, then create your own.

### ü§î Some recent thoughts / Questions I ask myself these days (updated periodically)
- Behind (almost) every product, there is a marketing person out there bending reality.
- Where is humans currently, in our "tech-tree"? Where are we heavily developed? Where are we lacking? Compared to "average"? We only have a sample size of one, but I think about this one a lot.
- [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) theory is really, really scary.
- Will we still use toilet paper in the year 2100 (I think yes)
- Recently bought a [SkyWatcher Classic 150P Dobsonian](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/sky-watcher-classic-150p) telescope. Bought it used, best $200 I spent in a while. Something about looking up at the sky gives you a sense of being human. Highly recommend. Plus, your neighbors will appreciate it.


## Favorites
### üéß Favorite Podcasts
- [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/) - Super cringe name, probably my favorite podcast. Business meets comedy, always provides great laughs and valuable lessons.
- [Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) - Weekly dose of scientific thinking. Someties a bit over the top, but a fun listen.
- [Pivot](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot) and [Prof G Pod](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/the-prof-g-pod-with-scott-galloway) - Famous for his wildly incorrect stock predictions, Scott Galloway (Prof G) gives interesting market insights and life lessons.
- [ML Street Talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/machine-learning-street-talk-mlst/id1510472996) - Most technical pod of the bunch, I try to keep up. Interesting characters as guests every week.

### üòé Favorite Hobbies
- Summer: Mountain Biking - Recent spots are Fujimi Panorama and Fujiten.
- Winter: Snowboarding
- All year: Exploring, I put >10,000km on my car purchased 1 year ago.
- DIY, and making my own furniture. Making things is my form of meditation.
