### ðŸ¤” Some recent thoughts / Questions I ask myself these days (updated periodically)
- Behind (almost) every product, there is a marketing person out there bending reality.
- Where is humans currently, in our "tech-tree"? Where are we heavily developed? Where are we lacking? Compared to "average"? We only have a sample size of one, but I think about this one a lot.
- [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) theory is really, really scary.
- Recently bought a [SkyWatcher Classic 150P Dobsonian](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/sky-watcher-classic-150p) telescope. Bought it used, best $200 I spent in a while. Something about looking up at the sky gives you a sense of being human. Highly recommend. Plus, your neighbors will appreciate it.

### ðŸŽ§ Podcasts
- [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/) - Super cringe name, probably my favorite podcast. Business meets comedy, always provides great laughs and valuable lessons.
- [Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) - Weekly dose of scientific thinking. Someties a bit over the top, but a fun listen.
- [Pivot](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot) and [Prof G Pod](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/the-prof-g-pod-with-scott-galloway) - Famous for his wildly incorrect stock predictions, Scott Galloway (Prof G) gives interesting market insights and life lessons.
- [ML Street Talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/machine-learning-street-talk-mlst/id1510472996) - Most technical pod of the bunch, I try to keep up. Interesting characters as guests every week.
