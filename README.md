I'm just here to make interesting stuff that I would want in my life.

Born in Japan, raised in the US. Thanks to my parents, I can communicate fluently in both English and Japanese.\
Currently in TokyoðŸ—¼

### some recent thoughts:
- Behind (almost) every product, there is a marketing person out there bending reality.
- Where is humans currently, in our "tech-tree"? Where are we heavily developed? Where are we lacking? Compared to "average"? We only have a sample size of one, but I think about this one a lot.
- [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) theory is really, really scary.
- Recently bought a [SkyWatcher Classic 150P Dobsonian](https://www.skywatcherusa.com/products/sky-watcher-classic-150p) telescope. Bought it used, best $200 I spent in a while. Something about looking up at the sky gives you a sense of being human. Highly recommend. Plus, your neighbors will appreciate it.
